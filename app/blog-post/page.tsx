          The Wild Truth and Our Why
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-4">
          Sustainable brands have struggled with visibility, affecting their functionality
          and success. A notable example is Shaker London, which shut down despite rebranding
          due to financial constraints from market invisibility.

          "Sustainable shopping isn’t just a trend; it’s the future. Every
          purchase you make is a vote for the kind of world you want to live in."
